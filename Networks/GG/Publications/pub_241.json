They are seen as nature\u2019s intangible benefits related to human perceptions, attitudes and beliefs. People obtain spiritual enrichment, cognitive development, reflection, recreation and aesthetic experiences from ecosystems (Table 1). People\u2019s perceptions can differ significantly, not only person by person, but also from one area and culture to another. Therefore, CES are not readily transferrable from one place to other environments.CES have both use and non-use values including existence, bequest, option and intrinsic values. Relational values referring to cultural identity and well-being derived from people\u2019s relationships with both other people and nature and mediated by particular places are also typical of CES. The focus of CES can be on individual needs and values or those fulfilled and possessed at a collective level. At both levels, CES concretely contribute to human well-being, public health and psychological experiences. As a result, CES are greatly appreciated by people and, in many instances, they are even better acknowledged than other ES. In more traditional communities, CES are often essential for cultural identity, livelihoods and even survival. The problem is, however, that many CES are difficult to quantify or their value too complex to assess and map.
