        "abstract": "In semiarid regions, drought is a frequent phenomenon that causes serious problems for agricultural crops and that constitutes a real threat to food security. This chapter proposes the use of a drought index based on a temporal series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) MODIS images for the monitoring of drought in France during the last 15 years at a spatial resolution of 250\u2009m. The goal is to show how to track and map drought using quantum geographic information system (QGIS) free software. It uses the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), which has been tested at different sites, revealing its strong potential for detecting and monitoring the drought. The chapter identifies two classes of drought: extreme to moderate drought: VCI\u2009<\u200920%; and no drought: VCI\u2009>\u200920%. It explains the steps to calculate the agricultural, forest and urban areas within each drought polygon."
