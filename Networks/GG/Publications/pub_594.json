        "abstract": "Proteins are the major nitrogen-containing biochemical constituents of plants. Since nitrogen (N) cannot be measured directly using remote sensing data, leaf protein content constitutes a valid proxy for this main limiting plant nutrient. In the past, mainly linear parametric algorithms, such as vegetation indices, have been employed to retrieve this non-state variable from optical reflectance data. Moreover, most studies solely relied on the relationship of chlorophyll content with nitrogen. In contrast, our study presents a hybrid model inversion scheme of a physically-based approach via protein retrieval combined with advanced machine learning regression. The leaf optical properties PROSPECT-PRO model, including the newly calibrated specific absorption coefficients (SAC) of proteins, was coupled with the canopy reflectance model 4SAIL to PROSAIL-PRO.
