        "abstract": "The objective of this study is to analyze the sensitivity of airborne GNSS-R signals to the characteristics of the soil surface and vegetation over agricultural areas. Airborne polarimetric GNSS-R data were acquired in the context of the GLORI'2015 campaign along five flights performed over the June-July 2015 period. Ground measurements of soil surface parameters (moisture content and surface roughness) and vegetation characteristics (Leaf Area Index (LAI), Vegetation Water Content (VWC) and vegetation height) for different cover types (wheat, corn, sunflower\u2026) were collected simultaneously to the airborne measurements. The GNSS-R observables (Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), Reflectivity) illustrate a moderate to good correlation with the vegetation characteristics (more specifically vegetation height) or the surface soil moisture."
