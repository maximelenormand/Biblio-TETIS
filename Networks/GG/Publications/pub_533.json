        "abstract": "Landform mapping is the initial step of many geomorphological analyses (e.g. assessment of natural hazards and natural resources) and requires vast resources to be applied to wide areas at high-resolution. Among geomorphological objects, we focus on glacial moraine mapping, since it is a task relevant to many fields (e.g. paleoclimate and glacial geomorphology). Here we proposed to exploit the potential of Deep Learning-based approaches to map moraine landforms by exploiting multi-source remote sensing imagery. To this end, we propose the first Deep Learning model to map glacial moraines, namely MorNet. As multi-source remote sensing information, we combine together three different sources: Topographic (Pleiades-derived DSM), Multispectral (Sentinel-2), and SAR (Sentinel-1) data. To cope with such heterogeneous information, the proposed model has a dedicated branch for each input source \u2026"
