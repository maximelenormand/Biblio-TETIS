We tested the hypothesis that patients with coronary artery disease and increased BF% have a higher risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) and that fat\u2010free mass is associated with better prognosis.We included 717 patients referred to cardiac rehabilitation after coronary artery disease events or procedures who underwent air displacement plethysmography to assess BF%; 75% were men, with a mean age 61.4\u00b111.4 years and a mean body mass index of 30\u00b15.4 kg/m2. Follow\u2010up was performed using a record linkage system. Patients were classified in sex\u2010specific quartiles of BF% and fat\u2010free mass index. The composite outcome of MACEs included acute coronary syndromes, coronary revascularization, stroke, or death from any cause. After \u2026"
