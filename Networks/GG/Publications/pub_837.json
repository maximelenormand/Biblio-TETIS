        "abstract": "Territorial development aims to renew public action and find solutions to major societal challenges. Making use of the new information and communication technologies, territorial observatories are also cooperative mechanisms that favour collective learning processes. Their implementation is complicated and difficult because it involves building, at the same time, an organization, a project and an information system in a process of mutual validation. CoObs, a method for the collaborative design of territorial observatories, is based on the deployment of three models: the model of territorial dynamics, the model of action and the model of observation. The article introduces and presents this method. Based on an analysis of two experiences, in the French West Indies and the Bassin de Thau in southern France, the authors show that territorial observatories contribute to the knowledge society by permitting citizen \u2026"
