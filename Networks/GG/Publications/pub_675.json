        "abstract": "The aim of this communication is to present an operational approach for mapping soil moisture at high spatial resolution (plot scale) in agriculture areas by coupling S1 and S2 images. The proposed approach is based on the inversion of the Water Cloud Model (WCM) combined with the modified Integral Equation Model (IEM). Neural networks were developed and validated using synthetic SAR C-band database. The results showed that the soil moisture could be estimated in agricultural areas with an accuracy of approximately 5 vol.%."
