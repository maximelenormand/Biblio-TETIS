        "abstract": "Multi-sensor systems are increasingly demanding in recent remote sensing (RS) applications. Combination of LiDAR and imaging spectrometers is an emerging technique used by several recent airborne systems. The combined data provide both functional and structural information, which makes this technique a unique tool for understanding and management of the Earth's ecosystems. The rapid development of this technique demands the simulation and validation of the combined data. In this paper, we introduce a new method to simulate data fusion of multi-sensor system which combined LiDAR and imaging spectrometer, with any experimental, instrumental, and geometrical configurations of systems. This method is implemented in the latest release of discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model."
