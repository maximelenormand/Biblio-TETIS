        "abstract": "Mineland rehabilitation is intended to reduce the overall impacts of mining on biodiversity and ecosystem services and requires periodic monitoring to guarantee institutional tractability and to refine rehabilitation practices. As time- and money-consuming field surveys challenge this monitoring, the aim of this study was to develop a remote sensing framework to assess the environmental quality of minelands undergoing rehabilitation based on free and open-access multispectral Sentinel-2 images. For this purpose, we linked spectral diversity, i.e., measures of spectral variation among neighboring pixels, to the field-surveyed environmental quality of a rehabilitation chronosequence covering five waste piles in the Caraj\u00e1s National Forest, Eastern Amazon. Field data were separated into a training data set from 2017 (54 plots) and a testing data set from 2019 (66 plots). Based on the training data set, we optimized the \u2026"
