        "abstract": "Nowadays, Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) are employed as input to derive land cover maps (LCM) to support decision makers in several application domains like agriculture and biodiversity. The generation of LCM largely relies on available ground truth (GT) data to calibrate supervised ma-chine learning models. Unfortunately, this data are not always accessible. In this scenario, the possibility to transfer a model learnt on a particular year (source domain) to another period of time (target domain) could be a valuable tool to deal with the previously mentioned restrictions. In this paper, we provide an experimental evaluation of recent Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods in the specific context of temporal transfer learning for SITS-based LCM. The objective is to learn a classification model at a certain year (exploiting available GT data) and, successively, transfer such a model on a subsequent year \u2026"
