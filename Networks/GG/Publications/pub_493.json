        "abstract": "Effects on fatigue behaviors and microstructures of Surface Mechanical Attrition Treatment (SMAT) before or after precipitation aging have been investigated on two hardenable Al alloys.The aluminum alloy with high notch sensitivity (7075) should not be processed by SMAT as the generated low surface integrity is always detrimental to fatigue performances. On less notch sensitive alloys (2024), SMAT before aging formed smaller and denser precipitates, resulting in a high hardened depth, and microstructures more resistant to residual stress relaxation than after conventional shot-peening. SMAT after aging resulted in a significant improvement of fatigue performance with only subsurface crack nucleation sites."
