        "abstract": "Systematically assessing the influence of new urban plans is an important challenge for designing them efficiently. In this paper, we propose a method to assess the influence of local \u2018Right to Build\u2019 regulations on constructibility. Our method is based on an optimization algorithm that generates building configurations. This method requires a geographic model that supports the formalization of the Right to Build regulation in order to check if a building respects it. The proposed approach relies on the trans-dimensional simulated annealing optimization method, which produces building configurations composed of a set of parametric objects (boxes in our implementation). Our proposition is released as the SimPLU3D Open-Source project (http://ignf.github.io/simplu3D/). In this paper, we present some tests and results based on this implementation and a use related to the assistance to \u2018Right to Build\u2019 designers."
