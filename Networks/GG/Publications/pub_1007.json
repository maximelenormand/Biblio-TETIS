        "abstract": "The effect of proximities on socioeconomic network construction has led to numerous debates in the economic geography literature. Our contribution aims to study the local processes of economic development in the rural territories, mobilizing the analysis of social networks and of proximity dynamics in a complementary way. To do so, we study the local productive arrangements (LPA) of two agricultural supply chains in the Brazilian Amazon. These arrangements are coordinated by the same territorial governance system, representative of the actions taken by the Brazilian government to promote territorial development. The analytical framework mobilized allow us to study and compare LPA, to propose an initial characterization of network types by proximity types, and to highlight the importance of the territorial governance system in strengthening and sustaining the LPA."
