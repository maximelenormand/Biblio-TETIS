        "abstract": "ObjectiveIn this paper we compare two distinct olive-based agroecosystems, their socialecological characteristics and importance for food security. These are: 1) Historical grafted oleaster-olive agroecosystems found throughout the Maghreb, based on a case study conducted in northern Morocco in a sampled area in Ouezzane Province, 2) Modern olive plantations using microcuttings raised in nurseries and a range of techniques favored by new agrarian policies in the same zone. We analyze practices involved in their development, their distribution and spatial organization, diversity of food products; environmental factors including the topographic wetness index (TWI) based on a field numeric model (SRTM 2014) and the topographic position index (TPI).The Rif borders the Mediterranean Sea to the north and is a region crossed by a mountain range that stretches from the Tangerine peninsula (west) to the frontier of Algeria (east). It is inhabited by three socio-linguistic groups, the Jbala (arabophone), the Ghomara and Berber Rifians (berberophone)."
