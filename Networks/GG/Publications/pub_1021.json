        "abstract": "Forest biomass plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle and its conservation or increase is a key element of land-based mitigation policies. Better tools to monitor forest biomass carbon stocks at high spatial resolution (10-50 meters) are needed in managed forests. In the past, forest inventories have been the main method to estimate forest biomass, but they have low revisit time and limited spatial sampling. Recently, forest biomass maps based on various remote sensing approaches have been developed, often with a global coverage and a medium to low resolution (~ 100 to 1 km). We present here a deep learning model based on multi-streams remote sensing measurements (GEDI LiDAR, Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 hyperspectral) to create high spatial and temporal resolution biomass and height maps over the Landes forest in France, a large pine plantation of 13,000 km\u00b2 with flat terrain and intensive \u2026"
