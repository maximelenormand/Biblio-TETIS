        "abstract": "We present a list of 175 new quasar candidates detected by a convolutional neural network (CNN) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82 with a fixed recall of 0.97. The imaging data used in our work consists of objects solely from the publicly available variable source catalog (UWVSC; Ivezic et al.(2007, Cat. J/AJ/134/973), Sesar et al.(2007AJ.... 134.2236 S)) constructed by researchers at the University of Washington. This catalog contains 67,507 unresolved, variable candidates with g<= 20.5 mag, at least 10 observations in both g and r bands, and a light curve with a root-mean-scatter (rms)> 0.05 mag and chi2 per degree of freedom> 3 in both g and r bands. The CNN takes the variability of objects into account by converting light curves into images. The CNN provides good results since its precision is 0.988 for a recall of 0.90, compared to a precision of 0.985 for the same recall with a random forest classifier \u2026"
