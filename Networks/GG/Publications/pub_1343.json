        "abstract": "The recognition of a spatial data infrastructure (SDI), as a two-sided market, leads the way to an innovative approach for analysing the strategies used to bring two groups of users into interdependent markets. The literature derived from the recent industrial organisation is rich in theoretical models, aiming at the study of price structure and product design, which maximise the participation of the groups, the profits of the firms, and the value created for the entire ecosystem. The current paper interprets and adapts the theoretical model of the two-sided market in order to fit the case of a SDI. The purpose is to highlight the relevance of a two-sided market approach for analysing a SDI dynamics. The focal research question is how spatial data infrastructure, through a platform management process, can transition from a government-funded entity to a self-sustaining operation. The analysis relies on the specific case of the \u2026"
