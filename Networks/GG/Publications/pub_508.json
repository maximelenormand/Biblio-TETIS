        "abstract": "The aim of this study is to assess the effects and interests of integrating remote-sensing-derived parameters (LAI, harvest and irrigation dates) in a crop model (PILOTE) that simulates vegetation growth for hay crops. The target variable is the prediction of Total Dry Matter (TDM) production in each of the three growth cycles.Two scenarios are employed to process the available remotely sensed LAI values, predicting TDM values when forcing in PILOTE either the initial and maximal optical LAI-values, or the initial, maximal and daily interpolated LAI values. The predictions show low deviations compared with the in situ TDM values (RMSE of 0.44 t/ha, MAPE of 23%).The feasibility of using harvest dates that are derived from optical data is examined by feeding the model with randomly perturbed harvest dates. The magnitude of the perturbations is equal to the revisit times of the current optical sensors. Optical images \u2026"
