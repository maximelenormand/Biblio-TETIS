In this respect, linking the accounts related to the same individual enables a more complete and thorough analysis of online behaviors. Indeed, the complexity of scenarios concerning the analysis of linked accounts across multiple platforms raises an emergence for developing effective models and methods to understand the characteristics and dynamics of multiple, interconnected types of user relations. In this context, we leverage the importance of studying the dichotomy between information-producers (contributors) and information-consumers (lurkers), and their interplay over a multilayer network, in order to effectively analyze the different roles a user may take on different OSNs.
