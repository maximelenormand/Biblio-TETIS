        "abstract": "Quantification of forest\u2019s vertical structure in the tropics using remote sensing is a challenge. NASA\u2019s Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is collecting spaceborne LiDAR data, whereas the ESA\u2019s next Earth Explorer BIOMASS mission will acquire multiple acquisitions over the same areas to form three-dimensional images through SAR tomography (TomoSAR) technique. We show that GEDI and P-band TomoSAR can directly measure vegetation heights and vertical profiles with high resolution and precision. The GEDI vegetation height error is 5 m at the tropical sites, similar to the expected performance of the future spaceborne BIOMASS mission. These results suggest GEDI measurements, i.e., RH98 from full power shots with sensitivity greater than 98%, will provide a good reference of forest structure to calibrate the BIOMASS mission algorithms."
