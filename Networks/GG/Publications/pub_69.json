        "abstract": "When visiting a touristic venue, building personalized itineraries is often non-trivial, mainly because of the variety of types of points-of-interest (PoIs) that might be considered by an individual. Several online platforms exist to support the tourists by providing them with detailed PoI-related information in a certain area, such as routes, distances, reviews, and ratings. However, integrating all these aspects can be tricky, and finding a reasonable trade-off between spatial/temporal proximity, amount and serendipity of the PoIs to visit can be challenging even for expert tourists. In this work, we propose a novel approach to the recommendation of a set of PoIs for a geographic area set around a given seed PoI, by leveraging a multilayer local community detection framework. The seed-centric communities are discovered in a complex network system, whose nodes correspond to PoIs and relations in the different \u2026"
