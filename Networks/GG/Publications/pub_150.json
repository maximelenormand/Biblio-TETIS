        "abstract": "Leaf area index estimates in dense evergreen tropical moist forest almost exclusively rest on indirect methods most of which being of limited accuracy or spatial resolution. In this study we examine the potential of full waveform Aerial Laser Scanning (ALS) to derive accurate spatially explicit estimates of Plant Area Index (PAI).A discrete representation of the forest canopy is introduced in the form of a 3D voxelized space. For each voxel (elementary volume, typically one cubic m) a first estimate of local transmittance of vegetation is computed as the ratio of the sum of energy exiting a voxel to the sum of energy entering the same voxel. A spatially hierarchical model is subsequently applied to refine estimates of individual voxel transmittance. Plant area density (PAD) profiles are then computed from the local transmittance values by applying Beer Lambert's turbid medium approximation. PAI values are obtained from \u2026"
