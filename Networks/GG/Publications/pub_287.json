        "abstract": "The results of this study are presented in three parts. First, we describe the political, legal and administrative logics that shaped the spatial planning in Australia and France. We then present the planning tools and systems they have generated in each country. In the third part, we study planning approaches space and the instruments developed to meet the challenges specificities of the anthropogenic artificialisation of agricultural land in peri-urban areas in Australia and France. Their concrete implementation the local scale is then described. The conclusion opens on the question of data, information and their uses to support these policies in both countries, an issue developed in the chapters following. At first, however, we present the approach and data we used to perform this comparative study."
