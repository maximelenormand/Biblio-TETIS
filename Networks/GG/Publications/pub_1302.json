        "abstract": "One of the key challenges in sustainable development consists in balancing manifold demands and concerns of actors. This includes respecting different scales of interest, different actor types and consequently different priorities framed by private and public constraints. The concept of ecosystem services (ES) provides a powerful framework for assessing the impact of land use and land management change (LULMC) scenarios to inform decision processes and support actor involvement from the management planning unit up to the landscape scale. This presentation intends to demonstrate how a fully integrative scenario modeling and ES based impact assessment can be structured, which requests need to be satisfied to get different actor types on board and what kind of information on spatial pattern and temporal fluctuations in ecosystem services provision and related trade-offs can be operationalized to address different information requests."
