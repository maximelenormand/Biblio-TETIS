        "abstract": "Territorial development reshapes public action by involving citizens in the choice, management and monitoring of public services, and by promoting the representation of populations that are usually excluded (Tonneau et al., 2011). The corollary is an engagement by citizens that goes beyond the traditional reliance on political or administrative representatives. However, local actors do not always wish to participate in the territorial governance that decentralization is gradually establishing, nor do they think they have the legitimacy or even the competence to do so. Nevertheless, the appropriation of territorial governance by local actors is essential for the emergence and implementation of dynamic, innovative and sustainable territorial projects. How can they be motivated or convinced to go down this path? Based on the literature and our field experience, we posit that this involvement in development has to be learned and that the research community has an important role to play in this learning process. learning for territorial developmentLearning, by which we mean the acquisition of new know-how and knowledge that actors can use in the decision-making process (Vitry and Chia, 2016), often takes place in collective contexts. We thus refer to organizational or social learning, which goes beyond the individuals. Research on social learning (Leeuwis and Pyburn, 2002) has shown the importance of creating learning situations, in which actors can go beyond their defensive routines, share their positions, develop unifying ideas, define new common values together and then collectively put them into practice (Coudel et al., 2011; Dar\u00e9 et al., 2010)."
