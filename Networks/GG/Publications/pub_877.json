        "abstract": "Photometric redshift estimation plays a crucial role in modern cosmological surveys for studying the universe\u2019s large-scale structures and the evolution of galaxies. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful method to produce accurate photometric redshift estimates from multiband images of galaxies. Here, we introduce a multimodal approach consisting of the parallel processing of several subsets of prior image bands, the outputs of which are then merged for further processing through a convolutional neural network (CNN). We evaluate the performance of our method using three surveys: the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS), and the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC). By improving the model\u2019s ability to capture information embedded in the correlation between different bands, our technique surpasses state-of-the-art photometric redshift precision. We find \u2026"
