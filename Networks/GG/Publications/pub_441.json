        "abstract": "In a context of increasing anthropization at the interface between protected areas and rural communal areas in southern Africa, the multiplication of interactions between wildlife and livestock may generate conflicts such as competition for natural resources, predation, crop destruction by wildlife, or the risk of pathogen transmission. To better understand these potential contacts, we have developed a method combining remote sensing and spatial modelling to simulate the movements of domestic ruminants (cattle) and wild animals (buffaloes)."
