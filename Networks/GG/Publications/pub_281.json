        "abstract": "Monitoring semi-natural grasslands is difficult and costly because they occur in highly dynamic and extremely complex habitat mosaics. We combined the use of a low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry to acquire high spatial resolution (\u223c1.5 cm pixel) RGB imagery. After image classification through Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA), we accurately were able to distinguish three semi-natural grassland types, one of which is a habitat of conservation concern. The use of orthomosaics, digital elevation models (DEMs), and canopy height models (CHMs) yielded excellent overall classification accuracies (>89%) assessed through both remotely validated and ground-truthed points. We identified two layers of woody vegetation with a user's (UA) and producer's (PA) accuracies >73% and three grassland types: closed grassland (UA = 94%; PA = 97%), open grassland \u2026"
