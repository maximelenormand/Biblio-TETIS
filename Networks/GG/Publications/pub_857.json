        "abstract": "In intensively managed forests in Europe, where forests are divided into stands of small size and may show heterogeneity within stands, a high spatial resolution (10\u2013\u2013\u201320 m) is needed to capture the differences in canopy height. In this work, we developed a deep learning model based on multi-sensor remote sensing measurements to create a high-resolution canopy height map over the \u201cLandes de Gascogne\u201d forest in France, a large maritime pine plantation of 13,000 km2 with flat terrain and intensive management. This area is characterized by even-aged and mono-specific stands, of a typical length of a few hundred meters, harvested every 35 to 50 years. Our deep learning U-Net model uses multi-band images from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 with composite time averages as input to predict tree height derived from GEDI waveforms. The evaluation is performed with external validation data from forest inventory \u2026"
