        "abstract": "In France, clear-cuts are a logging practice regulated by law under the Forest Code. The French Ministry of Agriculture, in charge of forest policies, needs exhaustive mapping methods to monitor the clear-cuts and allow its agents to efficiently take actions in the field. We present here the evolution of a clear-cut detection service relying on optical satellite data, from very high spatial resolution images to Sentinel-2 time series. Its nationwide deployment was possible due to a favorable context both technical and institutional."
