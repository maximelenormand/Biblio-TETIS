Existing methods for solving this problem, however, are not conceived to work on complex networks. In this paper, we proposeIenco, D. a novel framework for local community detection based on the multilayer network model. Our approachSallaberry, A. relies on the maximization of the ratio between the community internal connection density and the external connection density, according to multilayer similarity-based community relations. We also define a biasing scheme that allowsPoncelet, P. the discovery of local communities characterized by different degrees of layer-coverage diversification.
