        "abstract": "Full waveform (FW) LiDAR systems have gained momentum to map forest biophysical variables in the last two decades, owing to their ability to accurately estimate canopy heights and aboveground biomass. Currently, the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) system on board of the International Space Station (ISS) is the most recent FW spaceborne LiDAR instrument for the continuous observation of earth's forests. Here, we assess the accuracy of GEDI FW data for the estimation of stand-scale dominant heights (  ), and stand volume (V) using linear and nonlinear regression models based on several GEDI metrics. The models were calibrated and validated using in-situ data from Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil. Overall, the most accurate estimates of    and V were obtained using the stepwise regression, with an RMSE of 1.44 m (R2 of 0.92) and 24.39 m 3 .ha \u22121  (R2 of 0.90) respectively. The \u2026"
