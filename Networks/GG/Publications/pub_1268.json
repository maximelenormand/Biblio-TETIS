        "abstract": "Land productivity change is one of three indicators used to assess land degradation for reporting on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15.3.1. This study aimed to analyze the sensitivity of this indicator to three parameters (i) the period of analysis, (ii) the rainfall dataset used for climate correction, and (iii) the annual NDVI integration period (civil year vs climatic year). We observed that the spatial pattern and values of the resulting land productivity indicators greatly differ according to these three parameters, questioning the comparability of SDG indicator 15.3.1 between countries in different agroclimatic zones."
