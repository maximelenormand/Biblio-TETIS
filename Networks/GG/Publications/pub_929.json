        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a multidimensional mapping approach for heterogeneous textual data that exploits firstly the spatial dimension and secondly the thematic dimension. Based on the Spatial Textual Representation (STR) as well as the Geodict geographic database, the contribution presented in this paper integrates the thematic dimension of documents. To support our proposal on mapping textual documents, we evaluate the different aspects of the process using two real corpora, including one corpus that is highly heterogeneous.  "
