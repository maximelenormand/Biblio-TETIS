It was created from three corpora: the first one includes 10 transcriptions of YouTube videos and 70 tweets manually annotated. The second corpus is composed by the same textual data but automatically annotated with Named Entity Recognition (NER) tools. These two corpora have been built to evaluate NER tools and apply them to a bigger corpus. The third corpus is composed of 100 YouTube transcriptions automatically annotated with NER tools. The aim of the annotation task is to recognize spatial information such as the names of the cities and epidemiological information such as the names of the diseases. An annotation guideline is provided in order to ensure a unified annotation and to help the annotators. This dataset can be used to \u2026"
