        "abstract": "Since the late 1990\u2019s, a series of participatory experiments in real-life land development situations were undertaken in Senegal. The challenge was to set any land-related knowledge and views in a position of being refuted through a deliberative process, without prescribing specific technical, assessment or planning methods, and in which the participants engaged in participatory simulation games might freely imagine alternatives, and shape their own views and proposals. In 2014, several NGOs and social movements in the Senegalese civil society appropriated this method in a collaborative bottom-up process with farmers up to the national level. This paper presents and analyses a few dimensions of this process and its outputs. More specifically, it focuses on the procedures which generated, through participatory simulation workshops, the emergence of collective principles and rules at local levels then \u2026"
