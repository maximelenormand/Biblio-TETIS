        "abstract": "This letter proposes a deep learning model to deal with the spatial transfer challenge for the mapping of irrigated areas through the analysis of Sentinel-1 data. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model called \u201cTeacher Model\u201d is trained on a source geographical area characterized by a huge volume of samples. Then, this model is transferred from the source area to the target area characterized by a limited number of samples. The transfer learning framework is based on a distill and refine strategy, in which the teacher model is first distilled into a student model and, successively, refined by data samples coming from the target geographical area. The proposed strategy is compared with different approaches including a random forest (RF) classifier trained on the target data set and a CNN trained on the source data set and directly applied on the target area as well as several CNN classifiers trained on the \u2026"
