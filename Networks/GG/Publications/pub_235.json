        "abstract": "The use of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) as a tracer of photosynthesis is rapidly expanding with increasing numbers of measurements from towers, drones, aircrafts, or satellites. But how to integrate all the informative potential of these multiscale datasets? The connection between ChlF and photosynthesis takes place via multiple mechansisms that depend on the scale. At the leaf level, diurnal variations in ChlF may indicate changes in photochemical or non-photochemical quenching processes, whereas seasonal variations may indicate changes in the protein structure or pigment composition of the photosynthetic apparatus. At the canopy level, variations in ChlF may also reflect changes in total leaf area, canopy structure, species composition, changes in illumination or sun-target-sensor geometry, background properties, etc. At the pixel level, the dynamics of the atmosphere are also important.
