        "abstract": "Biodiversity monitoring is a challenge especially for large or isolated areas such as entire continents or remote mountain summits or islands, respectively. Nowadays, remote sensing technology such as spaceborne and airborne sensors provide images over large and remote areas that incorporate wavelengths, and thus information, that cannot be seen with the human eye. This is also now accomplished at unprecedented spatial resolutions, defined by the pixel size of images, achieving less than a meter for some satellite images and just centimeters for drone and aircraft imagery. Thanks to different modelling techniques relying on this data-rich information repeatedly provided over time as contiguous gridded layers, it is now possible to remotely assess biodiversity changes in space and time over different spatial scales and variable dimensions. To achieve this aim, the spectral species concept-a method that \u2026"
