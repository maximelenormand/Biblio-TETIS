        "abstract": "The timely and accurate identification of food insecurity situations represents a challenging issue. Household surveys are routinely used in low-income countries and are an essential tool for obtaining key food security indicators that are used by decision makers to determine the targets of food security interventions.This paper investigates the spatial and temporal quality of the food security indicators obtained through household surveys. The empirical case of Burkina Faso is used in this paper, where a large-scale rural household survey has been conducted yearly since 2009. From this data set, three food security indicators (the Food Consumption Score, the Household Dietary Diversity Score and the Coping Strategies Index) are calculated at the regional level for each year during the 2009\u20132017 period.Results highlight that observed spatiotemporal variations in these indicators \u2026"
