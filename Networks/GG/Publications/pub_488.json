So far they have received scant mutual theoretical discussions, despite enjoying widespread attention and empirical support. Both One Health and EcoHealth are conceptual movements, scientific areas, and political endeavours. However, their development has been driven by different scientific concerns, institutional frameworks, and cultures. One Health deals with biomedical questions, with an emphasis on zoonoses, and is historically more health science-driven. In contrast, the EcoHealth concept is defined as an ecosystem approach to health, tending to focus on environmental and socioeconomic issues and initially \u2026"
