On-Farm Experimentation (OFE) contributes to overcoming these limitations because it places farmers at the center of innovation processes, while ensuring rich interactions with various value chain actors. The richness of OFE is in part explained by the diversity of stakeholders involved and the co-learning that results from their interactions. Studies in management and social sciences show that such open innovation processes can be difficult to manage. Aligning the visions and interests of the different stakeholders, fostering the sharing of resources and knowledge to produce value, and sharing the value created in an equitable manner remain a real challenge.
