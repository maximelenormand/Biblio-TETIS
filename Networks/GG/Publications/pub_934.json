        "abstract": "An accurate knowledge of irrigation timing and rate is essential to compute the water balance of irrigated plots. However, at the plot scale irrigation is a data essentially known by the irrigator. These data do not go up to higher management scales, thus limiting both the management of water resources on a regional scale and the development of irrigation decision support tools at the farm scale. The study focuses on 6 experimental plots in the south-west of France. The new method consists in assessing surface soil moisture (SSM) change between observations and a water balance model. The approach was tested using both in situ measurements and surface soil moisture (SSM) maps derived from Sentinel-1 radar data. The score is obtained by assessing if the irrigation event is detected within+/-three days. The use of in situ SSM showed that:(1) the best revisit time between two SSM observations is 3 days; short \u2026"
