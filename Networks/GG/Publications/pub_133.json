        "abstract": "Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is a lidar system on-board the International Space Station designed to study forest ecosystems. However, GEDI footprint low accuracy geolocation is a major impediment to the optimal benefit of the data. We thus proposed a geolocation correction method, GeoGEDI, only based on high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) and GEDI derived ground elevations. For each footprint, an error map between GEDI ground estimates and reference DEM was computed, and a flow accumulation algorithm was used to retrieve the optimal footprint position. GeoGEDI was tested on 150 000 footprints in Landes and Vosges, two French forests with various stands and topographic conditions. It was applied to GEDI versions 1 (v1) and 2 (v2), by either a single or four full-power laser beam tracks. GeoGEDI output accuracy was evaluated by analyzing shift distributions and \u2026"
