        "abstract": "PADI-web (Platform for Automated extraction of animal Disease Information from the web) is a biosurveillance system dedicated to monitoring online news sources for the detection of emerging animal infectious diseases. PADI-web has collected more than 380,000 news articles since 2016. Compared to other existing biosurveillance tools, PADI-web focuses specifically on animal health and has a fully automated pipeline based on machine-learning methods. This paper presents the new functionalities of PADI-web based on the integration of: (i) a new fine-grained classification system, (ii) automatic methods to extract terms and named entities with text-mining approaches, (iii) semantic resources for indexing keywords and (iv) a notification system for end-users. Compared to other biosurveillance tools, PADI-web, which is integrated in the French Platform for Animal Health Surveillance (ESA Platform), offers strong \u2026"
