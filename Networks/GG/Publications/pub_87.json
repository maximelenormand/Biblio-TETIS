        "abstract": "Huge amount of data are nowadays produced by a large and disparate family of sensors, which typically measure multiple variables over time. Such rich information can be profitably organized as multivariate time-series. Collect enough labelled samples to set up supervised analysis for such kind of data is challenging while a reasonable assumption is to dispose of a limited background knowledge that can be injected in the analysis process. In this context, semi-supervised clustering methods represent a well suited tool to get the most out of such reduced amount of knowledge. With the aim to deal with multivariate time-series analysis under a limited background knowledge setting, we propose a semi-supervised (constrained) deep embedding time-series clustering framework that exploits knowledge supervision modeled as Must- and Cannot-link constraints. More in detail, our proposal, named conDetSEC \u2026"
