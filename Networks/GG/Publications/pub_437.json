        "abstract": "Many real world data can be modeled by a graph with a set of nodes interconnected to each other by multiple relationships. Such a rich graph is called multilayer graph or network. Providing useful visualization tools to support the query process for such graphs is challenging. Although many approaches have addressed the visual query construction, few efforts have been done to provide a contextualized exploration of query results and suggestion strategies to refine the original query. This is due to several issues such as i) the size of the graphs ii) the large number of retrieved results and iii) the way they can be organized to facilitate their exploration. In this article, we present  VERTIGo , a novel visual platform to query, explore and support the analysis of large multilayer graphs.  VERTIGo  provides coordinated views to navigate and explore the large set of retrieved results at different granularity levels. In addition \u2026"
