        "abstract": "Remote sensing technologies induce services and products which improve our perception of Earth. Payloads provide measurements that are transformed into services, such as harvest estimates, environment protection, pandemic prevention... The goal of the study is to diagnose markets' opportunities, over a 5-10 years projection, to see them in the light of research topics, in order to determine the innovation strategic axis and to help enhance technology and skill transfers."
