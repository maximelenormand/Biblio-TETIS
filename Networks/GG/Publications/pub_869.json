        "abstract": "Radiative transfer models have long been used to characterize the foliar content at the leaf and canopy levels. However, they still do not apply well to close-range imaging spectroscopy, especially because directional effects are usually not taken into account. For this purpose, we introduce a physical approach to describe and simulate the variation in leaf reflectance observed at this scale. Two parameters are thus introduced to represent (1) specular reflection at the leaf surface and (2) local leaf orientation. The model, called COSINE (ClOse-range Spectral ImagiNg of lEaves), can be coupled with a directional\u2013hemispherical reflectance model of leaf optical properties to relate the measured reflectance to the foliar content. In this study, we show that, when combining COSINE with the PROSPECT model, the overall PROCOSINE model allows for a robust submillimeter retrieval of foliar content based on numerical \u2026"
