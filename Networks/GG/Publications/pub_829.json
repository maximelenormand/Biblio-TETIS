        "abstract": "This chapter presents the application of spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric techniques to ground surface deformation resulting from human activity. Fluid extraction and cavity excavation are the main anthropogenic sources of subsidence. Subsurface anthropogenic activity can also amplify natural subsidence and can even trigger significant earthquakes. Interferometric SAR (InSAR), as a space\u2010based geodetic tool, thus provides interesting imaging capability for the mapping and monitoring of land motion in response to anthropogenic activities. InSAR can be applied for example during all phases of tunneling projects: before, to identify pre\u2010existing ground movements; during the work; and after the completion of the work for residual deformation monitoring. InSAR also plays a growing role in evaluating water\u2010management practices and in \u2026"
