        "abstract": " To date, there is no definitive approach to map snow depth in mountainous areas from spaceborne sensors. Here, we examine the potential of very-high-resolution (VHR) optical stereo satellites to this purpose. Two triplets of 0.70\u202fm resolution images were acquired by the Pl\u00e9iades satellite over an open alpine catchment (14.5\u202fkm2) under snow-free and snow-covered conditions. The open-source software Ame's Stereo Pipeline (ASP) was used to match the stereo pairs without ground control points to generate raw photogrammetric clouds and to convert them into high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) at 1, 2, and 4\u202fm resolutions. The DEM differences (dDEMs) were computed after 3-D coregistration, including a correction of a \u22120.48\u202fm vertical bias. The bias-corrected dDEM maps were compared to 451 snow-probe measurements. The results show a decimetric accuracy and precision in the Pl\u00e9iades-derived snow depths. The median of the residuals is \u22120.16\u202fm, with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.58\u202fm at a pixel size of 2\u202fm. We compared the 2\u202fm Pl\u00e9iades dDEM to a 2\u202fm dDEM that was based on a winged unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV) photogrammetric survey that was performed on the same winter date over a portion of the catchment (3.1\u202fkm2). The UAV-derived snow depth map exhibits the same patterns as the Pl\u00e9iades-derived snow map, with a median of \u22120.11\u202fm and a SD of 0.62\u202fm when compared to the snow-probe measurements. The Pl\u00e9iades images benefit from a very broad radiometric range (12 bits), allowing a high correlation success rate over the snow-covered areas. This study demonstrates the value of \u2026"
