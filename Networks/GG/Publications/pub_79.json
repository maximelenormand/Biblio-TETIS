        "abstract": "The articles in this special section focus on the reloading of feature-rich information networks. The growing availability of multi-facetedrelational data gives rise to unprecedented opportunities for unveiling complex real-world behaviors and phenomena. This also supports the proliferation of complex network models where the expressive power of the graph-based relational structure is enhanced through exposing several types of features that are peculiar of the domainspecific environment (e.g., social media platforms, biological environment, geographical location). Examples of feature-rich networks include heterogeneous information networks, multilayer networks, temporal networks, location-aware networks, and probabilistic networks. The aim of the special section is to address challenging issues and emerging trends in feature-rich information networks that can be mined in various domains."
