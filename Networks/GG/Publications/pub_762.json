We illustrate this debate with an example based on the Tuy Province in West Burkina Faso, which has known an important development these last fifteen years, as mainly observable in the major regression of its natural vegetation.The objective of this article is to question the possible future scenarios of this region, by using a spatial model to understand past land change mechanisms and prospect plausible future ways of development. In particular, the spatial model describes the vegetation clearance processes identified during field campaigns, which we used to draw prospective scenarios and assess their possible effect on natural vegetation evolution.The processing of remote sensing images helped us reveal that one quarter of the total \u2026"
