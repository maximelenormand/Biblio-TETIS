        "abstract": "  Background:  Research on the associations between walking and cycling with obesity-related phenotypes is growing but relies mostly on the use of BMI. The purpose of this study was to analyze associations of walking and cycling behaviors assessed separately with various obesity markers in French adults. Methods: In 12,776 adult participants (71.3% women) of the on-going NutriNet Sant\u00e9 web-cohort, we assessed by self-report past-month walking and cycling (for commuting, errands and leisure), and obesity measures were taken during a visit at a clinical center (weight, height, waist circumference, and percent body fat by bioimpedance). Results: In analyses not taking into account other types of physical activity (household, leisure), walking more than 2.5 h/week was associated in women with lower weight (-1.8 kg), waist circumference (-1.7 cm) and percent body fat (-1.1%) (all p < 0.001 \u2026"
