        "abstract": "National-scale assessments of post-deforestation land-use are crucial for decreasing deforestation and forest degradation-related emissions. In this research, we assess the potential of different satellite data modalities (single-date, multi-date, multi-resolution, and an ensemble of multi-sensor images) for classifying land-use following deforestation in Ethiopia using the U-Net deep neural network architecture enhanced with attention. We performed the analysis on satellite image data retrieved across Ethiopia from freely available Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and Planet-NICFI satellite data. The experiments aimed at an analysis of (a) single-date images from individual sensors to account for the differences in spatial resolution between image sensors in detecting land-uses, (b) ensembles of multiple images from different sensors (Planet-NICFI/Sentinel-2/Landsat-8) with different spatial resolutions, (c) the use of multi-date \u2026"
