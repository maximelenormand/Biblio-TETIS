        "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning is crucial in many applications where accessing class labels is unaffordable or costly. The most promising approaches are graph-based but they are transductive and they do not provide a generalized model working on inductive scenarios. To address this problem, we propose a generic framework, ESA\u2606, for inductive semi-supervised learning based on three components: an ensemble of semi-supervised autoencoders providing a new data representation that leverages the knowledge supplied by the reduced amount of available labels; a graph-based step that helps augmenting the training set with pseudo-labeled instances and, finally, a classifier trained with labeled and pseudo-labeled instances. Additionally, we also introduce two variants of our framework adopting different graph-based pseudo-labeling strategies: the first, ESALP, is based on a confidence-aware label propagation \u2026"
