        "abstract": "The ability to rapidly detect outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases is a health priority of global health agencies. In this context, event-based surveillance (EBS) systems gather outbreak-related information from heterogeneous data sources, including online news articles. EBS systems, thus, increasingly marshal text-mining methods to alleviate the amount of manual curation of the freely available text. This paper documents the use of datasets obtained through an EBS system, PADI-Web (Platform for Automated extraction of Disease Information from the web), dedicated to digital outbreak detection in animal health. This paper describes the datasets used for improving 3 important tasks related to PADI-Web, i.e., news classification, information extraction and dissemination"
