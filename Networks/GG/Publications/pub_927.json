        "abstract": "Land monitoring using temporal series of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images requires radiometrically well calibrated sensors. In this paper, the radiometric stability of the new SAR Sentinel-1A \u201cS-1A\u201d sensor was first assessed by analyzing temporal variations of the backscattering coefficient (\u03c3\u00b0) returned from invariant targets. Second, the radiometric level of invariant targets was compared from S-1A and Radarsat-2 \u201cRS-2\u201d data. The results show three stable sub-time series of S-1A data. The first (between 1 October 2014 and 19 March 2015) and third (between 25 November 2015 and 1 February 2016) sub-time series have almost the same mean \u03c3\u00b0-values (a difference lower than 0.3 dB). The mean \u03c3\u00b0-value of the second sub-time series (between 19 March 2015 and 25 November 2015) is higher than that of the first and the third sub-time series by roughly 0.9 dB. Moreover, our results show that the stability of each sub-time series is better than 0.48 dB. In addition, the results show that S-1A images of the first and third sub-time series appear to be well calibrated in comparison to RS-2 data, with a difference between S-1A and RS-2 lower than 0.3 dB. However, the S-1A images of the second sub-time series have \u03c3\u00b0-values that are higher than those from RS-2 by roughly 1 dB."
