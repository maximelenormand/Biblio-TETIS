        "abstract": "Proximities' influence on the construction of socio-economic networks provokes many debates in the literature. The present contribution aims to study the functioning of coordination between actors in support systems for agricultural sectors and to highlight the impact of a public policy of territorial development on these devices, with the help of an approach in terms of networks and proximities. For that, we analyze the Local Productive Arrangements (LPAs) of an agricultural sector in the Brazilian Amazon, supported by a territorial governance mechanism. The mobilized analysis framework allows us to study and compare LPAs, to characterize the types of networks according to the types of proximities and to highlight the importance of the territorial governance mechanism for strengthening and sustaining LPAs."
