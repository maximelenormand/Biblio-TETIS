        "abstract": "Multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) is a widely used technique to measure the ground subsidence and has already shown its ability to map such phenomena on a large spatial scale with millimetric accuracy from space. In Vietnam, to have independent SAR data for surface risk applications, a new X-band SAR mission (JV-LOTUSat) has been scheduled for launch for the 2019-2020 timeframe. However, Vietnam is located in tropical regions where their conditions are impacted by strong atmosphere. The aim of this article is to provide a better understanding of the capabilities of the X-band for estimating the ground subsidence under tropical atmospheric conditions. Analysis is carried out on two stacks, TerraSAR-X and Cosmos SkyMed X-band, from 2011 to 2014 in Ha Noi. We show that the results on the ground subsidence from InSAR processing can describe consistently the \u2026"
