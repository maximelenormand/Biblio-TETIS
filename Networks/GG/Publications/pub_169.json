        "abstract": "In this article, firstly we briefly summarise the sud4science project and data collection (http://sud4science.org), ensuing processing/analysing stages, and the resulting corpus, 88milSMS (http://88milsms.huma-num.fr), through a synthesis of quotes and references to previous articles (\u00a7 1). Secondly, we provide a state of the art on some research initiatives that use 88milSMS in various domains and frameworks, which will enable future cross-disciplinary insight (\u00a7 2). Then, we present other usages of the 88milSMS corpus we identified through surveys (\u00a7 3). Finally, we suggest future paths for textual data collection and analysis."
