        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose spatial extensions of the Object Constraint Language associated to UML. The goal of the proposed languages is to allow expressing a large range of integrity constraints in spatial databases. We highlight two extensions of OCL to express constraints involving spatial regions; the first one is based on the topological relations of the 9-Intersection model, and the second one is based on topological relations qualified by adverbs. We establish the equivalence between the expressive powers of these two extensions. Their difference is their level of usability. Our proposals have been integrated in a code generator OCL2SQL; this makes possible to produce automatically operational integrity mechanisms issued from OCL constraints. We also present a case study concerning the application of the proposed solution on an information system for agricultural spreading."
