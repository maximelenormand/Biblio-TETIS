To fulfill the high demand for food with an ever-increasing global population, better planning of irrigation is required. Therefore, more focus is being set on the assessment of irrigation performance for improving water management in order to achieve higher water productivity and increase agricultural water sustainability. In the context of mapping irrigated areas, we propose an innovative approach to map irrigated areas using Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and Sentinel-2 (S2) optical time series. Our proposed approach is based on the use of S1 and/or S2 time series combined with statistical \u2026"
