In order to discover articles of potential importance to infectious disease emergence it is important to mine the Web with an accurate vocabulary. In this paper, we present a new methodology that combines text-mining results and visualisation approach in order to discover associations between hosts and symptoms related to emerging infectious disease outbreaks."
