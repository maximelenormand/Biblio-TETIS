        "abstract": "With the recent progresses in lidar technology for Earth remote sensing, the development of a reliable lidar simulator is becoming central in order to define specifications for new sensors, perform intercomparisons, train machine learning algorithms, and help transferring information from one scale to another. The discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model includes such a lidar simulator. Although already tested on several virtual scenes, the DART outputs still need to be rigorously evaluated against actual sensor acquisitions, especially on real complex scenes of various forest types, such as dense tropical forests. That is the purpose of the present study. A real airborne laser scanner (ALS) with full-waveform capacity was first radiometrically calibrated on targets of measured reflectance. The properties of the ALS system were then introduced in the DART model, along with a 3-D virtual scene built from \u2026"
