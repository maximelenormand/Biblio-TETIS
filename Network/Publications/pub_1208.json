The work in this paper is part of the methodology for monitoring the web that we currently develop for the French epidemic intelligence team in animal health. We focus on the new and exotic infectious animal diseases that occur worldwide and that are of potential threat to the animal health in France.In order to detect relevant information on the web, we present an innovative approach that retrieves documents using queries based on terms automatically extracted from a corpus of relevant documents and validated with a consensus of domain experts (Delphi method). As a decision support tool to domain experts we introduce a new measure for ranking of extracted terms in order to highlight the more relevant terms. To categorise documents retrieved \u2026"
