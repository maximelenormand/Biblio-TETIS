        "abstract": "SAR and optical imagery provide highly complementary information about observed scenes. A combined use of these two modalities is thus desirable in many data fusion scenarios. However, any data fusion task requires measurements to be accurately aligned. While for both data sources images are usually provided in a georeferenced manner, the geo-localization of optical images is often inaccurate due to propagation of angular measurement errors. Many methods for the matching of homologous image regions exist for both SAR and optical imagery, however, these methods are unsuitable for SAR-optical image matching due to significant geometric and radiometric differences between the two modalities. In this paper, we present a three-step framework for sparse image matching of SAR and optical imagery, whereby each step is encoded by a deep neural network. We first predict regions in each image which \u2026"
