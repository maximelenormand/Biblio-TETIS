        "abstract": "Forest ecosystems play a fundamental role in natural balances and climate mechanisms through their contribution to global carbon storage. They also represent important reservoirs of biodiversity. The sustainable management and conservation of forest resources is, therefore, crucial in the current context of global warming and biodiversity loss. To tackle such challenges, earth observation data has been identified as a valuable source of information capable to provide stakeholders with informative indicators to support the decision making process related to forest ecosystems management. In particular, LiDAR remote sensing has proven to be a powerful tool for the characterization of structural properties of forest ecosystems, which in turn are valuable information for their monitoring. To deal with this particular issue in the context of simultaneous forest variables estimation in a multi-output regression setting, we \u2026"
