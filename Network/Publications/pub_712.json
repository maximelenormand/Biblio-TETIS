        "abstract": "It is increasingly recognised that the good quality of life of city dwellers depends on the provision of a variety of urban ecosystem services (UES) within cities. However, soil sealing, associated with urbanisation and densification policies, affects soil multifunctionality and compromises the supply of future UES delivered both by public and private land. Incentive-based instruments could provide additional means of action for urban open space protection. Yet, their ability to produce conservation patterns that are cost-effective has been questioned, especially when they rely on public funding. To address this concern, this paper argues that conservation return on investment (ROI) analysis can be applied to UES supply protection objectives. We present an application of this method to a purchase of development right program within the Greater Paris metropolitan area (France). We assess and map the supply variation of \u2026"
