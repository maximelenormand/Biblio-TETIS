        "abstract": "We release photometric redshifts, reaching \u223c0.7, for \u223c14M galaxies at r \u2264 20 in the 11\u2009500 deg2 of the SDSS north and south Galactic caps. These estimates were inferred from a convolution neural network (CNN) trained on ugriz stamp images of galaxies labelled with a spectroscopic redshift from the SDSS, GAMA, and BOSS surveys. Representative training sets of \u223c370k galaxies were constructed from the much larger combined spectroscopic data to limit biases, particularly those arising from the over-representation of luminous red galaxies. The CNN outputs a redshift classification that offers all the benefits of a well-behaved PDF, with a width efficiently signalling unreliable estimates due to poor photometry or stellar sources. The dispersion, mean bias, and rate of catastrophic failures of the median point estimate are of order \u03c3MAD = 0.014, <\u0394znorm>=0.0015,  on a \u2026"
