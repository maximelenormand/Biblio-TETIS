        "abstract": "The glacier evolution from two valleys located near Vicdessos, French Pyrenees, is deciphered from 17 in situ cosmic ray exposure (CRE) dating. In the Picot valley, Late Glacial glacier advances were documented during Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1), while a rock glacier developed or was reactivated during the mid-Holocene. In the upper M\u00e9d\u00e9courbe valley, the largest visible ice extent occurred during the Younger Dryas (YD) or earlier. At least two moraines formed during the early Holocene were dated, while an undated moraine located close to the head of the catchment may have been formed either during the Late Holocene or the Little Ice Age. A mass balance model suggests that a temperature about 5.1 \u00b0C cooler than today, without precipitation change, would be necessary to form a moraine at the base of the Picot catchment during HS1 at 2000 m a.s.l. A temperature about 3.9 \u00b0C cooler than today is necessary \u2026"
