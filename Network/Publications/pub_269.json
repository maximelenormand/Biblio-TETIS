        "abstract": "The present study highlights the potential of multi-temporal X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) moisture products to be used for the calibration of a model reproducing soil moisture (SM) variations. We propose the MHYSAN model (Mod\u00e8le de bilan HYdrique des Sols Agricoles Nus) for simulating soil water balance of bare soils. This model was used to simulate surface evaporation fluxes and SM content at daily time scale over a semi-arid, bare agricultural site in Tunisia (North Africa). Two main approaches are considered in this study. Firstly, the MHYSAN model was successfully calibrated for seven sites using continuous thetaprobe measurements at two depths. Then the possibility to extrapolate local SM simulations at distant sites, based on soil texture similarity only, was tested. This extrapolation was assessed using SAR estimates and manual thetaprobe measurements of SM recorded at these distant sites \u2026"
