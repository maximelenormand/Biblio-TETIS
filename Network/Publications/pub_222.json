        "abstract": "The territory, defined as a geographical space as appropriated and perceived by individual or collective actors, evolves in space and time under the effects of natural and anthropogenic factors in an institutional, political and social context. It is therefore inherently dynamic. Planning and decision-making for territories consequently require a detailed knowledge and an objective representation of ongoing, expected or planned processes at different spatio-temporal levels of analysis.This chapter provides an overview of tools for monitoring and modelling territorial dynamics. Without claiming to provide a turn-key solution to analyzing and understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of territories, these tools can nonetheless be used as aids for decision-making for spatial planning. Remote sensing can help describe and quantify territorial dynamics, and spatial modelling can provide us a detailed understanding of the complex spatio-temporal processes underpinning these dynamics."
