        "abstract": "The global population is expected to increase from 7 billion to over 9.1 billion by the year 2050 (Godfray et al., 2010). To ensure the food security, approximately 70% more food than the available at present will be needed, which is expected to put agricultural production systems and the environment under pressure (FAO, 2013). According to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected climate change scenarios, the concern of increasing temperature and rainfall variability with drought events is more likely to further widen the gap between food supply and demand. Assessing and improving the resilience of cropping systems to climate change is a very critical issue, especially in the Mediterranean region (Rivington et al. 2007). Normally, in addition to being considered as a measure of stability and persistence (Gunderson and Holling 2002; Reggiani et al. 2002), some refer to resilience as the capacity of an ecosystem to shield itself against extreme factors (Carpenter et al. 2001). The ability of cropping systems to resist disturbance defines how resilience a system is (Enfors and Gordon 2007). Assessing spatial and temporal adaptations of a specific land use option or farming system, allows to identify the strategies/combination of strategies, priorities and measures which support the resilience of a cropping system against a change/set of changes. Diversities within land cover (e.g. cereals, legumes, orchards...etc.), farming system (i.e. rain-fed, irrigated and supplementary irrigated), cultivation system (e.g. intercropped farm, monoculture farm, mixed farm...etc.), soil type and fertility (Rodriguez et al. 2011) and availability of water \u2026"
