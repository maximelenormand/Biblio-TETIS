        "abstract": "Brazilian Low Carbon Agriculture Plan (ABC Plan) is one the initiatives that places the climate in the agricultural agenda towards a more sustainable and adapted agriculture under global changes. Among the several practices listed and supported by the ABC Plan, zero tillage and integrated crop-livestock-forestry systems including the recovery of degraded pasture are the most relevant ones. Those practices introduced a complexity to agriculture landscape image analyse. The objective of this paper is to present the GeoABC Project and preliminary procedures using OBIA and satellite based multi-scale methods to monitor the introduced scenario of a new agriculture land use dynamics."
