        "abstract": "Data produced by biodiversity research projects that evaluate and monitor \u2018Good Environmental Status\u2019 have a high potential for use by stakeholders involved in [marine] environmental management. The lack of specific scientific objectives, poor organizational logic, and a characteristically disorganized collection of information leads to a decentralized data distribution, hampering environmental research. In such a heterogeneous system across different organizations and data formats, it is difficult to efficiently harmonize the outputs. There are few tools available to assist."
