        "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) has proven to be a suitable approach for despeckling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. So far, most DL models are trained to reduce speckle that follows a particular distribution, either using simulated noise or a specific set of real SAR images, limiting the applicability of these methods for real SAR images with unknown noise statistics. In this article, we present a DL method, deSpeckNet,   that estimates the speckle noise distribution and the despeckled image simultaneously. Since it does not depend on a specific noise model, deSpeckNet generalizes well across SAR acquisitions in a variety of landcover conditions. We evaluated the performance of deSpeckNet on single polarized Sentinel-1 images acquired in Indonesia, The Democratic Republic of Congo, and The Netherlands, a single polarized ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 image acquired in Japan and an Iceye X2 image acquired in Germany \u2026"
