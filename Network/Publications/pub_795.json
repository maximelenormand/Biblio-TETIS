        "abstract": "Leaf biochemical and structural traits are vegetation characteristics related to various physiological processes. Taking advantage of the physical relationship between optical properties and leaf biochemistry, field-based spectroscopy has allowed for the rapid estimation of leaf biochemical constituents and repeated non-destructive measurements through time. Leaf constituent retrieval from leaf optical properties following inversion of the physically-based radiative transfer model PROSPECT is now a popular method, but some cases prompt poor retrieval success and this approach requires a strict inversion procedure. We investigated the performances of different inversion procedures for the estimation of leaf constituents, specifically chlorophyll a and b, carotenoids, water (EWT), and dry matter (LMA) from >1400 broadleaf samples, including the definition of optimal spectral subdomains, and the use of leaf \u2026"
