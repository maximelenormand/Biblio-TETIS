        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to develop an inversion approach to estimate surface soil moisture from X-band SAR data over irrigated grassland areas. This approach simulates a coupling scenario between Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical images through the Water Cloud Model (WCM). A time series of SAR (TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed) and optical (SPOT 4/5 and LANDSAT 7/8) images were acquired over an irrigated grassland region in southeastern France.An inversion technique based on multi-layer perceptron neural networks (NNs) was used to invert the Water Cloud Model (WCM) for soil moisture estimation. Three inversion configurations based on SAR and optical images were defined: (1) HH polarization, (2) HV polarization, and (3) both HH and HV polarizations, all with one vegetation descriptor derived from optical data. The investigated vegetation descriptors were the Normalized \u2026"
