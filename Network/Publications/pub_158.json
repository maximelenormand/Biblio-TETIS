        "abstract": "  To understand time\u2010lag dynamics in the response of biodiversity to contemporary environmental changes (e.g. macroclimate warming and atmospheric pollution), we need to consider former anthropogenic forcing factors such as past land uses and management practices that can have both compounding and confounding effects. This is especially true in European temperate forests, where legacies from past human activities have left strong imprints on today\u2019s understorey plant species composition, generating long\u2010term lagging effects which can be mistakenly attributed to more recent macro\u2010environmental changes. By combining the expertise of plant, soil and historical ecologists together with remote sensing scientists, we review the potential of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to unveil ghosts from the past in terms of former land uses and management practices. We show that imprints from past land uses \u2026"
