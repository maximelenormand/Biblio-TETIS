        "abstract": "SENTINEL-2 observations are particularly well suited for crop management due to the short revisiting time and decametric spatial resolution. In this context, Green Area Index (GAI), the fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation Intercepted by the green vegetation (FIPAR), the fractional green vegetation cover (GF(0)) and Leaf Chlorophyll Content (LCC), are four variables of particular interest since they relate to the canopy state and can eventually be assimilated into crop functioning models to predict crop yield and optimize management practices. We present the results from the first year of the P2S2 project (Produits Pour Sentinel-2) that consisted in acquiring an extensive calibration and validation dataset over agricultural areas based on DHP measurements for GAI, GF(0) and FIPAR combined with SPAD-502 Minolta chlorophyll meter acquisitions for LCC."
