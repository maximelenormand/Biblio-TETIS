        "abstract": "Senegal is experiencing an increasing demand for seasonal labour in the agricultural sector. In the context of family farming, this phenomenon results from a socio-economic differentiation induced by decades of State support for specific agricultural production models. This article analyses seasonal work from the perspective of seasonal workers, often socially and politically invisibilised. It aims to understand how this activity shapes their biographical trajectory and contributes to their livelihoods and those of their families. Based on data collected in 2018 and 2019 on seasonal workers in the Senegal River Delta and Niayes regions, we show that the precarious working conditions of this seasonal labour force, which is exclusively male in the areas studied, constraints livelihoods and accumulation as well as the collective action capacities of these workers."
