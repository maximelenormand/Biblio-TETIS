        "abstract": "In this work, we present a new semi-supervised learning framework to cope with satellite image time series (SITS) classification in a data paucity scenario, considering extreme low levels of supervision. The proposed methodology, referred as S 3 ITS (Semi-Supervised Satellite Image Time Series classification method), is based on temporal convolutional neural networks and it takes advantage of both labelled and unlabelled information. S 3 ITS enforces the data to be projected in a discriminative manifold via contrastive learning, in order to produce a data representation where samples belonging to the same category are closer than the ones belonging to different ones. Pseudo-labelling is employed on unlabelled samples to take the most out of the available unlabelled information. Experiments on two study sites described by SITS of Sentinel-2 images highlight the quality of the proposed method with respect to \u2026"
