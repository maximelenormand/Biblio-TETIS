        "abstract": "This paper assesses the potential of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) in the C and L bands to penetrate into the canopy cover of wheat, maize and grasslands. For wheat and grasslands, the sensitivity of the C and L bands to in situ surface soil moisture (SSM) was first studied according to three levels of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI < 0.4, 0.4 < NDVI < 0.7, and NDVI > 0.7). Next, the temporal evolution of the SAR signal in the C and L bands was analyzed according to SSM and the NDVI. For wheat and grasslands, the results showed that the L-band in HH polarization penetrates the canopy even when the canopy is well-developed (NDVI > 0.7), whereas the penetration of the C-band into the canopy is limited for an NDVI < 0.7. For an NDVI less than 0.7, the sensitivity of the radar signal to SSM is approximately 0.27 dB/vol.% for the L-band in HH polarization and approximately 0.12 dB/vol.% for the C-band (in both VV and VH polarizations). For highly developed wheat and grassland cover (NDVI > 0.7), the sensitivity of the L-band in HH polarization to SSM is approximately 0.19 dB/vol.%, whereas as the C-band is insensitive to SSM. For maize, only the temporal evolution of the C-band according to SSM and the NDVI was studied because the swath of SAR images in the L-band did not cover the maize plots. The results showed that the C-band in VV polarization is able to penetrate the maize canopy even when the canopy is well developed (NDVI > 0.7) due to high-order scattering along the soil-vegetation pathway that contains a soil contribution. According to results obtained in this paper, the L-band would penetrate a well \u2026"
