        "abstract": "We here present a reference database and three land use maps produced in 2017 over the Reunion island using a machine learning based methodology. These maps are the result of a satellite image analysis performed using the Moringa land cover processing chain developed in our laboratory. The input dataset for map production consists of a single very high spatial resolution Pleiades images, a time series of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images, a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and the aforementioned reference database. The Moringa chain adopts an object based approach: the Pleiades image provides spatial accuracy with the delineation of land samples via a segmentation process, the time series provides information on landscape and vegetation dynamics, the DTM provides information on topography and the reference database provides annotated samples (6256 polygons) for the supervised classification \u2026"
