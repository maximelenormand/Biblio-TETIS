        "abstract": "Technological advances in terms of data acquisition enable to better monitor dynamic phenomena in various domains (areas, fields) including environment. The collected data is more and more complex - spatial, temporal, heterogeneous and multi-scale. Exploiting this data requires new data analysis and knowledge discovery methods. In that context, approaches aimed at discovering spatio-Temporal patterns are particularly relevant. This paper1 focuses on spatio-Temporal data and associated data mining methods."
