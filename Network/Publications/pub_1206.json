        "abstract": "Active microwave measurements have the potential to estimate vegetation optical depth (VOD), an indicator related to vegetation water content and biomass. The Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) provides long-term C-band backscatter data at vertical-vertical (VV) polarization from 2007. So far, very few studies have considered retrieving VOD from this active sensor. This study presents a new publicly released global long-term and continuous (2007\u20132020) C-band VOD dataset retrieved from the ASCAT observations, named the ASCAT INRAE-BORDEAUX or ASCAT IB VOD product. The retrieval algorithm is based on the Water Cloud Model (WCM) including the Ulaby bare soil model. The algorithm takes advantage of a multi-temporal (MT) retrieval method relying on a cost function where constraints to the retrieved parameters are implemented and a reanalysis soil moisture (SM) dataset from ERA5-Land is \u2026"
