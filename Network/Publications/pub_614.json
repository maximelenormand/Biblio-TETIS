        "abstract": "This study evaluates the accuracy of several recent remote sensing Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) products at sites in southwestern France. The products used are Soil Moisture Active Passive \u201cSMAP\u201d (level 3: 36 km \u00d7 36 km, level 3 enhanced: 9 km \u00d7 9 km, and Level 2 SMAP/Sentinel-1: 1 km \u00d7 1km), Advanced Scatterometer \u201cASCAT\u201d (level 2 with three spatial resolution 25 km \u00d7 25 km, 12.5 km \u00d7 12.5 km, and 1 km \u00d7 1 km), Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity \u201cSMOS\u201d (SMOS INRA-CESBIO \u201cSMOS-IC\u201d, SMOS Near-Real-Time \u201cSMOS-NRT\u201d, SMOS Centre Aval de Traitement des Donn\u00e9es SMOS level 3 \u201cSMOS-CATDS\u201d, 25 km \u00d7 25 km) and Sentinel-1(S1) (25 km \u00d7 25 km, 9 km \u00d7 9 km, and 1 km \u00d7 1 km). The accuracy of SSM products was computed using in situ measurements of SSM observed at a depth of 5 cm. In situ measurements were obtained from the SMOSMANIA ThetaProbe (Time Domaine reflectometry) network (7 stations between 1 January 2016 and 30 June 2017) and additional field campaigns (near Montpellier city in France, between 1 January 2017 and 31 May 2017) in southwestern France. For our study sites, results showed that (i) the accuracy of the Level 2 SMAP/Sentinel-1 was lower than that of SMAP-36 km and SMAP-9 km; (ii) the SMAP-36 km and SMAP-9 km products provide more precise SSM estimates than SMOS products (SMOS-IC, SMOS-NRT, and SMOS-CATDS), mainly due to higher sensitivity of SMOS to RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) noise; and (iii) the accuracy of SMAP-36 km and SMAP-9 km products was similar to that of ASCAT (ASCAT-25 km, ASCAT-12.5 km and ASCAT-1 km) and S1 (S1-25 km, S1-9 km \u2026"
