        "abstract": "The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), specifically designed to measure vertical forest structures, has acquired, since April 2019, more than 35 billion waveforms of Earth\u2019s surface on a nearly global scale. GEDI is equipped with 3 identical 1064 nm lasers with a power of 10 mJ per shot, where 1 laser is split into 2 lasers, resulting in two 5 mJ coverage lasers and two 10 mJ full-power lasers. In this study, we evaluate the potential of GEDI\u2019s four lasers to penetrate through canopies and detect the ground, and their capabilities to detect the top of the canopies over a tropical forest (in French Guiana) characterized by a dense canopy cover and tall trees. The accurate detection of both of these surfaces is the first step in characterizing vertical forest structures. The SRTM Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is used as a reference point for elevations while a canopy height model (CHM), derived from airborne and spaceborne LiDAR data, is used as a reference for canopy heights. In addition, the ground and canopy-top elevations estimated from NASA\u2019s Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor (LVIS, 1064 nm full-waveform LiDAR, 5 mJ per shot, ~8 km altitude) are used as a benchmark for comparison with GEDI\u2019s lasers. Results indicate that GEDI\u2019s coverage and full-power lasers, even after the application of a preliminary filter that removes around 50% of acquisitions, tend to underestimate tree heights in densely vegetated, tall forests. Moreover, GEDI\u2019s coverage lasers also exhibited a lower level of performance in comparison to both the full-power lasers and LVIS. Overall, the average estimated maximum canopy heights (RH100) for a CHM greater \u2026"
