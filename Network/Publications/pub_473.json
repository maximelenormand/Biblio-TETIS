        "abstract": "Vegetation optical depth (VOD), as a microwave-based vegetation index for vegetation water and biomass content, is increasingly used to study the impact of global climate and environmental changes on vegetation. Currently, VOD is mainly retrieved from passive microwave data and few studies focused on VOD retrievals from active microwave data. The Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) provides long-term C-band backscatter data at Vertical-Vertical (VV) polarization. In this study, a new ASCAT INRAE Bordeaux (IB) VOD (hereafter, IB VOD), was developed based on the Water Cloud Model (WCM) coupled with the Ulaby linear model for soil backscattering. The main features of IB VOD are that (i) the ERA5-Land soil moisture (SM) dataset was used as an auxiliary SM dataset in the retrievals, (ii) pixel-based soil model parameters were mapped using Random Forest (RF), and (iii) the vegetation model parameter \u2026"
