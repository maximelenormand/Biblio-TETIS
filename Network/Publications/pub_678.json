        "abstract": "In cereals, the root system is mainly composed of post\u2010embryonic shoot\u2010borne roots, named crown roots. The CROWN ROOTLESS1 (CRL1) transcription factor, belonging to the ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2\u2010LIKE/LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN (ASL/LBD) family, is a key regulator of crown root initiation in rice (Oryza sativa). Here, we show that CRL1 can bind, both in\u2009vitro and in\u2009vivo, not only the LBD\u2010box, a DNA sequence recognized by several ASL/LBD transcription factors, but also another not previously identified DNA motif that was named CRL1\u2010box. Using rice protoplast transient transactivation assays and a set of previously identified CRL1\u2010regulated genes, we confirm that CRL1 transactivates these genes if they possess at least a CRL1\u2010box or an LBD\u2010box in their promoters. In planta, ChIP\u2010qPCR experiments targeting two of these genes that include both a CRL1\u2010 and an LBD\u2010box in their \u2026"
