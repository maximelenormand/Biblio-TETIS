        "abstract": "Due to their sessile life style, plant survival is dependent on the ability to build up fast and highly adapted responses to environmental stresses by modulating defense response and organ growth. The phytohormone jasmonate plays an essential role in regulating these plant responses to stress.To assess variation of plant growth responses and identify genetic determinants associated to JA treatment, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using an original panel of Vietnamese rice accessions. The phenotyping results showed a high natural genetic variability of the 155 tested rice accessions in response to JA for shoot and root growth. The level of growth inhibition by JA is different according to the rice varieties tested. We conducted genome-wide association study and identified 28 significant associations for root \u2026"
