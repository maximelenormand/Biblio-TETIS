The next European Space Agency Earth Explorer Core Mission BIOMASS will collect synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data globally from employing a multiple baseline orbit during the initial phase of its lifetime. These data will be used for tomographic SAR (TomoSAR) processing, with a vertical resolution of about 20 m, a resolution sufficient to decompose the backscatter signal into two to three layers for most closed-canopy tropical forests. A recent study, conducted in the Paracou site, French Guiana, has already shown that TomoSAR significantly improves the retrieval of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) in a high biomass forest, with an error of only 10% at 1.5-ha resolution. However, the degree to which this TomoSAR approach can be transferred from one site to another has not \u2026"
