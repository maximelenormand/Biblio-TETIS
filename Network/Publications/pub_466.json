        "abstract": "Data produced within marine and terrestrial biodiversity research projects that evaluate and monitor Good Environmental Status, have a high potential for use by stakeholders involved in environmental management. However, environmental data, especially in ecology, are not readily accessible to various users. The specific scientific goals and the logics of project organization and information gathering lead to a decentralized data distribution. In such a heterogeneous system across different organizations and data formats, it is difficult to efficiently harmonize the outputs. Few tools are available to assist. For instance standards and specific protocols can be applied to interconnect databases. Such semantic approaches greatly increase data interoperability. This communication present the recent results and the consortium IndexMEED (Indexing for Mining Ecological and Environmental Data) activity that aims to build new approaches to investigate complex research questions, and support the emergence of new scientific hypotheses based on graph theory Auber et al. 2014). Current developments in data mining based on graphs, as well as the potential for relevant contributions to environmental research, particularly about strategic decision-making, and new ways of organizing data will be presented (David et al. 2015). In particular, the consortium makes decisions on how i) to analyze heterogeneous distributed data spread throughout different databases combining molecular and habitat characteristics data [3], ii) to create matches and incorporate some approximations, iii) to identify statistical relationships between observed data and the \u2026"
