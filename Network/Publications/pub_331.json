        "abstract": "In Europe, the heterogeneous features of crop systems with majority of small to medium sized agricultural holdings, and diversity of crop rotations, require high-resolution information to estimate cropland Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) and its two main components of Gross Ecosystem Exchange (GEE) and the Ecosystem Respiration (R ECO). In this context, this paper presents an assimilation of high-resolution Sentinel-2 indices with eddy covariance measurements at selected European cropland flux sites in a new modified version of Vegetation Photosynthesis Respiration Model (VPRM). VRPM is a data-driven model simulating CO 2 fluxes previously applied using satellite-derived vegetation indices from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). This study proposes a modification of the VPRM by including an explicit soil moisture stress function to the GEE and changing the equation of R \u2026"
