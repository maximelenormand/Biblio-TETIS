        "abstract": "Despite the current short temporal coverage of high spatial resolution SM maps estimated from Synthetic Aperture Radars such as Sentinel-1(S1), their evaluation is important in the context of the ESA CCI as potential future high resolution (HR) SM long time series, and also as benchmarking references for HR SM data sets that could be obtained by downscaling coarser resolution sensors. In this context, 1 km HR SM maps obtained making a synergistic use of S 1 and Sentinel 2 (or Sentinel 3) using the    algorithm were compared to the HR SM data sets from the Copernicus Global Land Service produced from S 1 data over three regions in Europe and one in Tunisia. In addition, the    maps were also compared to the SMAP+S 1 downscaled product in those regions and in two additional ones in North America and Australia. The HR SM maps show an overall good agreement for croplands and \u2026"
