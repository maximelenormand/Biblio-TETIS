We successively tested the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH) for each retrieved OTI using the Rao's Q as heterogeneity index, validating them against Shannon's H values calculated as a tree species diversity index derived from in\u2010situ collected data.We demonstrated differences among OTIs in terms of how well their variations can be linked to species diversity.
