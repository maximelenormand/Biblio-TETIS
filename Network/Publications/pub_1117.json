        "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown results superior to most traditional image understanding approaches in many fields, incl. crop classification from satellite time series images. However, CNNs require a large number of training samples to properly train the network. The process of collecting and labeling such samples using traditional methods can be both, time-consuming and costly. To address this issue and improve classification accuracy, generating virtual training labels (VTL) from existing ones is a promising solution. To this end, this study proposes a novel method for generating VTL based on sub-dividing the training samples of each crop using self-organizing maps (SOM), and then assigning labels to a set of unlabeled pixels based on the distance to these sub-classes. We apply the new method to crop classification from Sentinel images. A three-dimensional (3D) CNN is utilized for \u2026"
