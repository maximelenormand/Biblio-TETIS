        "abstract": "Nowadays, satellite image time series (SITS) are commonly employed to derive land-cover maps (LCM) to support decision makers in a variety of land management applications. In the most general workflow, the production of LCM strongly relies on available GT data to train supervised machine learning models. Unfortunately, these data are not always available due to time-consuming and costly field campaigns. In this scenario, the possibility to transfer a model learnt on a particular year ( source domain ) to a successive period of time ( target domain ), over the same study area, can save time and money. Such a kind of model transfer is challenging due to different acquisition conditions affecting each time period, thus resulting in possible distribution shifts between  source  and  target  domains. In the general field of machine learning, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches are well suited to cope with \u2026"
