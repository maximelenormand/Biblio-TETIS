        "abstract": "Mapping rural buildings in developing countries is crucial to monitor and plan in those vulnerable areas. Despite the existence of some rural building annotations in OpenStreetMap (OSM), those are of insufficient quantity and quality to train models able to map large areas accurately. In particular, these annotations are very often misaligned with respect to the buildings that are present in updated aerial imagery. We propose a Markov Random Field (MRF) method to correct misaligned rural building annotations. To do so, our method uses i) the correlation between candidate aligned OSM annotations and buildings roughly detected on aerial images and ii) the local consistency of the alignment vectors."
