        "abstract": "Many real world data can be modeled by a graph with a set of nodes interconnected to each other by multiple relationships. Such a rich graph is called multilayer graph. We present a novel visual platform to query, explore and support the analysis of large multilayer graphs. Our approach provides coordinated views to navigate and explore the large set of retrieved results at different level of granularities. In addition, the proposed system supports the refinement of the query by visual suggestions to guide the user through the exploration process. A demo video is available at https://youtu.be/zray-iR8Hz0."
