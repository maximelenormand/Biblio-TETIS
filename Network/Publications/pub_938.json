        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess soil chemical and physical quality related to sorghum productivity in Gadambalyia schemes, north El-Gadarif. In this study Satellite images and GIS were integrated with soil quality to detect and map the type and degree of severity of soil degradation in Gadambalyia schemes. The type and degree of soil degradation was assessed through analyzing and mapping soil quality indicators. The indicators included physical (bulk density, clay percent, available water content, field capacity and hydraulic conductivity) and chemical properties (total nitrogen percent, pH, cation exchange capacity, and organic carbon). In 2005, soil samples were collected from forty five geo-referenced locations in the schemes. Soil quality indicators were determined and compared with the same indicators, determined previously in the same locations in 1976. The System Integration Risk (SIRIS) model was \u2026"
