        "abstract": "Nowadays, there is a general agreement on the need to better characterize agricultural monitoring systems in response to the global changes. Timely and accurate land use/land cover mapping can support this vision by providing useful information at fine scale. Here, a deep learning approach is proposed to deal with multi-source land cover mapping at object level. The approach is based on an extension of Recurrent Neural Network enriched via an attention mechanism dedicated to multi-temporal data context. Moreover, a new hierarchical pretraining strategy designed to exploit specific domain knowledge available under hierarchical relationships within land cover classes is introduced. Experiments carried out on the Reunion island-a french overseas department-demonstrate the significance of the proposal compared to remote sensing standard approaches for land cover mapping."
