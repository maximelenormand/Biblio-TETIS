        "abstract": "The article approaches the production, commercialization and consumption of rice in Brazil with focus on the State of Minas Gerais. This State occupied a featured position in the production of this cereal, but currently Minas Gerais production is of low significance considering the demand from its population. The article shows graphically the evolution and the behavior of rice production in Minas Gerais municipalities from 1990-2015. It contains information on the rice processing industries installed in the State related to the market share in the wholesale market, origin of the raw material, besides the perception of the wholesalers on the current situation of the demand. As rice continues to be part of the tradition and the rich cuisine of Minas Gerais, combined with the fact that the State presents conditions for producing and processing, an eventual development of the rice production chain would bring social and economic benefits."
