        "abstract": "The complex, dynamic and narrow boundaries between vegetation types make wetland mapping challenging. Hereafter the case study of the Hamoun-e-Hirmand wetland is considered by analysing eight Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Images acquired in dry and wet periods with three wavelengths (X-band ~ 3 cm, C-band ~ 6 cm, and L-band ~ 25 cm), three polarizations (HH, VV and VH), and four incidence angles (22\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 34\u00b0 and 53\u00b0). Then, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification method was applied to classify TerraSAR-X, Sentinel-1, and ALOS-PALSAR images. The final wetland land cover map was created by combining the classification results obtained from each sensor. In the case in question, results show that TerraSAR-X (X-band, HH-53\u00b0) and Sentinel-1 data (C-band, VV-34\u00b0) were useful for determining the flooded vegetation area in the wet period. This is crucial for the conservation of water \u2026"
