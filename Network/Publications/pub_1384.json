        "abstract": "This letter introduces the new European Settlement Map (ESM) production workflow, presents some indicatory results, and discusses the validation process. Unlike the previous ESM versions, the built-up (BU) extraction is realized through supervised learning (not only by means of image filtering and processing techniques) based on textural and morphological features. Input data are the Copernicus very-high-resolution image collection for the reference year 2015 coming from a variety of sensors. The workflow is fully automated, and it does not include any postprocessing. For the first time, a new layer containing nonresidential buildings was derived by using only remote sensing imagery and training data. The produced BU map is delivered at 2-m-pixel resolution (level-1 layer), while the residential/nonresidential layer (level 2) is delivered at 10-m spatial resolution. More than 46 000 scenes were processed, and \u2026"
