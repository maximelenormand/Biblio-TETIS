        "abstract": "Controlling the urban development and protecting the natural habitats are major challenges for urban planners. With respect to these challenges, we assess the influence of different spatial planning policies on the urban heat island (UHI) intensity and the energy demand for building space heating in Strasbourg\u2013Kehl urban region (France\u2013Germany). For this purpose, the SLEUTH* urban growth model is coupled off-line with the WRF/urban climate modeling system in order to simulate the impacts of three types of urban development (compact, moderately compact, and sprawling development) combined with ecological preservation rules. Two additional software applications, Graphab and MorphoLim, are used to define the ecological and urban spatial structures, and drive the SLEUTH* simulations. The simulations for the year 2010 are consistent with the existing climate data (mean bias on temperatures less than \u2026"
