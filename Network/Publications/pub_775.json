        "abstract": "Objects recognition in urban environment using multiband imagery is a difficult process, implying the use of elaborated and complex image processing methods, which are used to enhance the detection efficiency. The urban mosaics are characterized by multiple materials (e.g. manmade, urban vegetation, bare soil, transport infrastructure, etc.), which are combined together to form a complex patchwork. This study aims to take advantage of the multiband imagery, to assess the feasibility degree of the urban objects detection, and to explore some of the applications related to the multiband hyperspectral imagery classification."
