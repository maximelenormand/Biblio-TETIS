        "abstract": "Mapping forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is becoming an important task, particularly for the reporting of forest carbon stocks and their changes. An approach for AGB mapping over the tropical forest of French Guiana was developed using regression-kriging of remote sensing and environmental data. The RMSE on the AGB estimates is of 51 Mg/ha (R2=0.66) with 1 km resolution map. This paper summarizes the approach developed for tropical forest biomass retrieval and the main results."
