        "abstract": "Researches carried out in the last years have shown that the use of P-band SAR tomography (TomoSAR) largely improves the retrieval of the above-ground biomass (AGB) in tropical forests, providing a most encouraging element toward the systematic employment of TomoSAR techniques in the frame of the upcoming spaceborne mission BIOMASS. All of these researches were carried out using campaign data acquired in a single day, and under stable (mostly sunny) weather conditions. The impact of temporal decorrelation was considered in the literature by analyzing ground-based Radar data from the TropiSCAT campaign (Paracou, French Guiana), and found not to be a show-stopper for BIOMASS tomography. Yet, the validity of this analysis was limited to sunny days only. Accordingly, a precise assessment of the impact of changing weather conditions on TomoSAR is currently missing. The aim of this paper is \u2026"
