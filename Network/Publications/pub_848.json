        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an analysis of P band radar signal potential to retrieve soil moisture root profile. Our analysis is based on two electromagnetic models, the small perturbation method and the small slope approximation. There models consider electromagnetic scattering from three-dimensional layered structures with an arbitrary number of rough surfaces. Simulations are proposed for different types of moisture profiles, for different hydrological conditions."
