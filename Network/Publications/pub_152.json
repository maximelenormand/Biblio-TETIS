        "abstract": "Mapping the microclimate effect of forest canopies on understory temperature requires spatially explicit predictors at very fine spatial resolutions. Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) offers promising prospects in that regard, as it allows capturing the vertical dimension of vegetation structure at a very high resolution over large areas.To explore the potential of airborne LiDAR-derived metrics to predict understory temperature, we focused on the forest of Blois (France), a 2740-ha lowland managed forest dominated by oak (Quercus petraea). We installed HOBO sensors measuring microclimate air temperature at one-metre height in 53 stands of contrasting vegetation structure, from open to very dense and from young regeneration to mature stages. Using a nearby weather station as the macroclimate temperature reference, we calculated the slope (log scale) coefficient of the linear regression between microclimate \u2026"
