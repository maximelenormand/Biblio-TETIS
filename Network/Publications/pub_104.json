        "abstract": "Various strategies to accelerate the Lasso optimization have been recently proposed. Among them, screening rules provide a way to safely eliminate inactive variables, thus reducing the problem\u2019s dimensionality. Another line of work consists in replacing the dictionary matrix by a structured approximation of it, which is faster to manipulate. This paper proposes a method to conciliate both strategies. First, we show how to obtain safe screening rules for the exact problem while manipulating an approximate dictionary. We then adapt an existing screening rule to this new framework and define a general procedure to leverage the advantages of both strategies. Significant complexity reductions are obtained in comparison to screening rules alone."
