        "abstract": "One of the key challenges in sustainable development consists in balancing manifold demands and concerns of actors. This includes respecting different scales of interest, different actor types and consequently different priorities framed by private and public constraints. The concept of ecosystem services (ES) provides a powerful framework for assessing the impact of land use and land management change (LULMC) scenarios to inform decision processes and support actor involvement from the management planning."
