        "abstract": "Readitopics provides a new tool for browsing a textual corpus that showcases several recent work for labeling topic models and estimating topic coherence. We will demonstrate the potential of these techniques to get a deeper understanding of the topics that structure different kinds of datasets. This tool is provided as a Web demo but it can be easily installed to experiment with your own dataset. It can be further extended to deal with more advanced topic modeling techniques."
