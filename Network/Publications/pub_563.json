        "abstract": "Topic labeling aims at providing a sound, possibly multi-words, label that depicts a topic drawn from a topic model. This is of the utmost practical interest in order to quickly grasp a topic informational content \u2013 the usual ranked list of words that maximizes a topic presents limitations for this task. In this paper, we introduce three new unsupervised n-gram topic labelers that achieve comparable results than the existing unsupervised topic labelers but following different assumptions. We demonstrate that combining topic labelers - even only two - makes it possible to target a 64% improvement with respect to single topic labeler approaches and therefore opens research in that direction. Finally, we introduce a fourth topic labeler that extracts representative sentences, using Dirichlet smoothing to add contextual information. This sentence-based labeler provides strong surrogate candidates when n-gram topic \u2026"
