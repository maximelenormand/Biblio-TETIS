        "abstract": "With the increase of Urban Heat Islands (UHI) and the effects of global warming, cities will face challenges in anticipating these phenomena. However, the complexity of urban development within the framework of urban planning policies, makes difficult for urban decision-makers to anticipate the Urban Heat Islands within their territory. In this paper, we propose a methodology to assess the impact of urban planning policies on Urban Heat Island. Thanks to a coupling of 2D urban growth model, 3D constructability model and urban microclimate simulation, this tool will make it possible to visualize the impact of urban planning decisions on urban form and on Urban Heat Island."
