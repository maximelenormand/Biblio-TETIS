        "abstract": "The THEIA Land Data and Services Centre (www.theia-land.fr) is a consortium of 12 French public institutions involved in Earth observation and environmental sciences (CEA, CEREMA, CIRAD, CNES, IGN, INRA, CNRS, IRD, Irstea, M\u00e9t\u00e9o France, AgroParisTech, and ONERA). THEIA has been initiated in 2012 with the objective of increasing the use of space data by the scientific community and the public actors. THEIA structured the French scientific community 1) through a mutualized Service and Data Infrastructure (SDI) distributed between several centers, allowing access to a variety of products; 2) through the setup of Regional Animation Networks (RAN) to federate and animate users (scientists and public / private actors) and 3) through Scientific Expertise Centres (SEC) clustering virtual research groups on a thematic domain. One of this SEC is the \"Urbanization and Artificialization\u201d Centre clustering experts in multi-sensor urban remote sensing. THEIA in collaboration with ODATIS (Data and Service for the Ocean), ForM@Ter (Data and Service for the Solid Earth), and AERIS (Data and Service for the Atmosphere) form the \"Earth System\" Research Infrastructure. The objective of this poster is to present recent (>2016) innovations of the URBAN SEC in terms of (1) development of algorithms useful for urban remote sensing using optical and SAR sensors, (2) validation of the urban products provided by the THEIA Land Service and Data Infrastructure, and (3) demonstration of user-tailored applications for urban studies. The Urban Expert Centre brings together researchers and engineers from several institutes: LIVE - Strasbourg, IGN-LaSTIG \u2026"
