The main project purpose is to provide monitoring methodologies and spatial indicators in support of the ABC Plan governance-Sectorial plan for mitigation and adaptation to climate change aimed at consolidation of a low-carbon economy in agriculture (www. agricultura. gov. br). For this the project aims to evaluate innovative methods and techniques in the area of remote sensing and spatial data integration for the detection of farming practices and agricultural production systems aligned with low-carbon agriculture policies, such as: crop-livestock-forest integration; no-tillage grains crop; agroforestry systems; reforestation. The objective is to develop integrated methods to detect complex agricultural production systems since plots level-scale until landscape-scale in order to be able to monitoring the adoption of \u2026"
