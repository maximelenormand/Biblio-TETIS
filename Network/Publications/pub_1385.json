The \u201cUrban\u201d SEC brings together teams from several research laboratories in France that carry out research and develop innovative data processing methods for urban remote sensing using optical and SAR sensors. They are working on the validation of the urban products provided by the THEIA SDI and try to demonstrate user-tailored applications."
