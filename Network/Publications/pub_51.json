        "abstract": "In this chapter, we discuss computational approaches to identify and rank lurkers in online social networks. We begin with a formal definition of topology-driven lurking and a detailed description of a family of centrality methods specifically conceived for ranking lurkers solely based on network topology, namely LurkerRank. To better model dynamics of user behaviors, the Time-Aware LurkerRank models are also described. The chapter ends with the description of a learning-to-rank framework for lurker prediction and classification."
