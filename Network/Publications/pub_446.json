        "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to estimate geometric, water and physical surface soil parameters from typical semi-arid regions made over bare study area (North Africa) using multi-temporal X-band SAR images (TerraSAR-X). For spatial and temporal surface roughness estimation, empirical relationships between radar and soil roughness parameters (rms height \u201cHrms\u201d, and Zg parameter) were proposed. Two roughness classes are identified through radar signal inversion (smooth and ploughed soils). For the retrieval of surface soil moisture at a high spatial resolution, an algorithm combing TerraSAR-X images with continuous thetaprobe measurements was proposed. Two assumptions were studied: (1) roughness variations during the radar acquisition campaigns were not accounted for; (2) a simple correction for temporal variations in roughness was included. Finally, an empirical relationship was established between \u2026"
