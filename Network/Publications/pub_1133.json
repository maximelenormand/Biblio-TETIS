        "abstract": "The research and improvement of methods to be used for crop monitoring are currently major challenges, especially for radar images due to their speckle noise nature. The European Space Agency\u2019s (ESA) Sentinel1 constellation provides synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images coverage with a 6 days revisit period at a high spatial resolution of pixel spacing 20 m. Sentinel-1 data are considerable useful, as they provide valuable information of the vegetation cover. The objective of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the capabilities of Sentinel-1 radar images for rice height and dry biomass retrievals. To do this, we train Sentinel1 data against ground measurements with classical machine learning techniques (Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest (RF)) to estimate rice height and dry biomass. The study is carried out on a multi-temporal Sentinel-1 \u2026"
