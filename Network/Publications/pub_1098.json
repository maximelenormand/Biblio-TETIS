        "abstract": "The GLORIE GNSS-R airborne campaign was conducted in the late spring 2015 with the GLORI polarimetric receiver. More than 15 hours or raw data was gathered during 5 flights that spanned over a 3-week period. The aircraft flew over several areas if interest including: 1) agricultural plots with coincident in-situ measurements of soil moisture, vegetation biomass and roughness, 2) in situ monitored forest plots with a wide range of above ground biomass values and 3) inland water bodies in order to test phase altimetry retrievals. Apparent reflectivity was computed from the data, showing a good dynamics above various types of terrains. Phase altimetry was performed over calm water, showing a precision in the range of the centimeter level."
