        "abstract": "Mountain regions of the humid tropics are characterized by steep slopes and heavy rains. These regions are thus prone to both high surface runoff and soil erosion. In Southeast Asia, uplands are also subject to rapid land\u2010use change, predominantly as a result of increased population pressure and market forces. Since 1998, the Houay Pano site, located in northern Lao PDR (19.85\u00b0N 102.17\u00b0E) within the Mekong basin, aims at assessing the long\u2010term impact of the conversion of traditional slash\u2010and\u2010burn cultivation systems to commercial perennial monocultures such as teak tree plantations, on the catchment hydrological response and sediment yield. The instrumented site monitors hydro\u2010meteorological and soil loss parameters at both microplot (1 m2) and small catchment (0.6 km2) scales. The monitored catchment is part of the network of critical zone observatories named Multiscale TROPIcal CatchmentS (M \u2026"
