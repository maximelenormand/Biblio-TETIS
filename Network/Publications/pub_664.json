        "abstract": "Mapping zonations of mangrove species (ZMS) is important when assessing the functioning of such specific ecosystems. However, the reproducibility of remote sensing methods for discriminating and mapping mangrove habitats is often overstated due to the lack of temporal observations. Here, we investigated the potential use of temporal series of high-resolution multispectral satellite images to discriminate and map four typical Asian ZMS. This study was based on the analysis of eight images acquired between 2001 and 2014 over the mangrove area of Nusa Lembongan, Bali, Indonesia. Variations between years in the top-of-atmosphere reflectance signatures were examined as functions of the acquisition angles. We also applied maximum likelihood supervised classification to all of the images and determined the variability in the classification errors. We found that the distinction between spectral signatures of \u2026"
