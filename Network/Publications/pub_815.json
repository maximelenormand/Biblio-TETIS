        "abstract": "The assessment of rice yield at territory level is important for strategic economic decisions. Assessing spatial and temporal yield variability at regional scale is difficult because of the numerous factors involved, including agricultural practices, phenological calendars, and environmental contexts. New remote sensing data acquired at decametric resolution (Sentinel missions) can provide information on this spatial variability. The study objective was thus to evaluate the potential of Sentinel-2 images for monitoring rice cropping systems and yield from farm to region scales. The approach considered both observations and modeling. In-depth farmers surveys were carried out in the Camargue region, Southeastern France. The novelty was to use operational tools (BVNET and PHENOTB) to compute leaf area index, to daily interpolate this biophysical variable from 44 images acquired in 2016 and 2017 for each \u2026"
