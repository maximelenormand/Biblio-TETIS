Bibliometric analysis of the TETIS laboratory
========================================================================

This interactive web application provides a bibliographic analysis of publications (journal articles and conference papers) from the UMR TETIS between 2016 and 2024. The data have been harvested from Google Scholar. The application contains two tabs. The first tab allows you to visualize the co-publication network of UMR TETIS over a certain period of activity (in years) based on the affiliations, teams, and ad hoc groups. The second tab offers various analyses to visualize statistics regarding the number of publications per year according to different criteria.

This repository contains two folders, **Network** and **Vizu**. The first folder contains the raw data in .json format (**Publications** folder), a Python script to extract the co-publication network from the data, and an R script to extract and format the data for Shiny. The second folder contains all the materials (R scripts, .Rdata file, and the WWW data folder) needed to run [the app](http://shiny.umr-tetis.fr/Biblio_TETIS/).
