# Bibliometric analysis of the TETIS laboratory

## Description

This interactive web application provides a bibliographic analysis of the 
publications (journal articles and conference papers) from the UMR TETIS between
2016 and 2024. The data were harvested from Google Scholar. The application 
contains two tabs. The first tab allows you to visualize the co-publication 
network of UMR TETIS over a certain period of activity (in years), based on 
affiliations, teams, and ad hoc groups. The second tab offers various analyses 
to visualize statistics regarding the number of publications per year based on 
different criteria.

## Data & analysis

This repository contains two folders, **Network** and **Vizu**. The first folder
contains the raw data in .json format (**Publications** folder), a Python script
to extract the co-publication network from the data, and an R script to extract 
and format the data for Shiny. The second folder contains all the materials 
(R scripts, .Rdata file, and the www data folder) needed to run 
[the app](https://biblio-tetis.sk8.inrae.fr).
